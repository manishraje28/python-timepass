## 💡 TIPS FOR SUCCESS

### First Time Setup:
1. Run the app
2. Sit comfortably with good posture
3. Look at the camera for 5-10 seconds
4. System calibrates to your position
5. Start working normally

### Best Practices:
- Good lighting on your face
- Camera at eye level
- Clear background
- Comfortable seating position

### Health Tips:
- **20-20-20 Rule**: Every 20 min, look 20 feet away for 20 sec
- **Blink Rate**: Aim for 15-20 blinks/minute
- **Distance**: Arm's length from screen (~50-70 cm)
- **Breaks**: Take 5-min breaks every hour

## 🔧 CUSTOMIZATION

Want to adjust settings? Edit `smart_desk_monitor_simple.py`:

```python
# Line ~15-20: Adjust thresholds
self.distance_threshold_near = 1.3  # Change sensitivity
self.away_time_threshold = 5  # Seconds before alert
self.alert_cooldown = 5  # Time between alerts
```
